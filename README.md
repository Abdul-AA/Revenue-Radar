## Project Goals

For our project, we explore two major use cases related to customer conversion and revenue generated from conversions:

1. **Customer Conversion Analysis**: To identify trends in user behavior that lead to conversions, enabling targeted marketing strategies.
2. **Revenue Optimization**: To understand how conversions translate into revenue, providing insights for optimizing ad spend and marketing investments.

Our project aims to explore trends in user conversion, which can drive and improve our investment in marketing and ad spend for GStore, as well as any other retailers looking to leverage customer data to enhance their marketing spend.

Let's dive into the details of each use case for **Revenue Radar**.
