### Potential Business Questions
Top Choice (Currently)
What does the buyer journey from first visit to conversion look like? Could we move users through this journey more quickly?


Brainstorm
* What levers within our control can be adjusted to boost expected conversion rates? 
* How could we optimize ad spend based on findings? (this might not be suited to conversion? wouldn't the amount of revenue matter here? or no?)
* Which user profiles should be target ad-spend on? (same question here, not sure if revenue-or-not is enough to direct ad-spend Feels like we should be looking for something that is not sensitive to **how much** we make from them, but just if we make something or not)
* Consumers who are similar to those who convert but don't convert, what's different about them?
