## Data Acquistion / Transformation for User-Centric Conversion Analysis
The available dataset is at session level, with some users appearing multiple times. The below feartures should be engineered from the existing dataset to create one for which every record represents a unique user and characteristics of their user journey

This dataset can be used for data exploration at the user journey level. It is understood that not all features can, or should, be included in the eventual model. Rather it will serve as a starting point for feature selection and any potential further feature engineering.
